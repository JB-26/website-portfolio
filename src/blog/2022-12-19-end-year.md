Is it really the end of the year already? I canâ€™t quite believe it myself! Where did the year go?

Similar to what I did last [year](https://joshblewitt.dev/blog/2022-01-08-year-review/), this post is to share what Iâ€™ve done this year. This year has mostly been more focused on major real life events, such as [buying a house](https://joshblewitt.dev/blog/2022-07-30-buying-house/) and getting married. I (somehow) managed to find the time to work on some projects and make updates to this website.

Letâ€™s dive in with a summary of what I did:

- Upgraded this website in various waysâ€¦.
  - Went from Gatsby version 2 to version 4â€¦
  - â€¦and then went from Gatsby version 4 to version 5
  - Changed the background colour
  - Created the Archive page
  - Created the About page
  - Added new imagesâ€¦
  - â€¦reduced the size of the images
  - Added a new font
  - Using FontAwesome icons in the footerâ€¦
  - â€¦and ended up swapping out the Twitter icon for the Mastodon icon
- Worked on the season 22 Formula 1 project (and added ALL Grand Prix results)!
- Got married!
- Bought my own house!
- Travelled to the USA twice this year!

Letâ€™s talk about these points in more detail.

## This website

My website has changed quite a bit this year. In fact there have been over _100_ commits to the website repo this year!

Plenty of changes this year. Most of the changes were backend but I did add a new about page, archive page, along with new photos.

Going from Gatsby version 2 to version 5 was a big jump. One of the biggest improvements Iâ€™ve seen is that the build times for the website is much better when working on it locally.

## The Formula 1 2022 season data analysis project

This is a project that Iâ€™ve worked on over the year, and itâ€™s something that Iâ€™ve really enjoyed. The repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/JB-26/f1-2022-analysis) is filled with data for anyone who wants to take a look and start some analysis of their own.

Building the logic and refactoring it has been a good learning experience for me. Iâ€™ve never worked with data types like time delta until this project!

Thereâ€™s still plenty of opportunities to do some more data analysis until the 2023 season.

## GitHub

This year alone Iâ€™ve made over 270 contributions on all my [repos](https://github.com/JB-26)! Itâ€™s quite clear when I was on holiday when you look at the table (to be fair, I was travelling a lot this year).

Maybe next year Iâ€™ll break 300 contributions?

## Real life

The two big life events of this year has been getting married and buying a house. Both of these events happened within a few days of each other AND I was able to do this before I turned thirty (by less than a month). I also donâ€™t recommend completing your house purchase while in another country, that is tricky to manage.

It may have taken me **eight years** but I did buy my own home before I was thirty. The process of buying a home is a wild ride. Itâ€™s something that I donâ€™t want to do again for many years.

Moving house has been a challenge in itself. I have been kept busy by building furniture, getting services (like gas, electricity, etc) setup, cleaning, organising and more. Itâ€™s tough work running a house. Thereâ€™s still plenty of work to do, I need to get curtains, blinds, wardrobes and lamp shades (Iâ€™m pretty sure thereâ€™s more Iâ€™ve forgot to mention).

## Plans for 2023

WIth the new year, I have the following challenges I want to tackle:

- Read more
- Work more on Data Analysis/Data Science
- Make some more improvements to this website (redesign maybe?)
- More blog posts, on things other than programming. Like what software Iâ€™m using etc. Maybe even books Iâ€™ve read!
- Work on the house

## Wrap up

Itâ€™s been a crazy busy year for me. Iâ€™m kinda hoping 2023 will be slightly quieter, but also more productive. For now, Iâ€™m looking forward to an Ikea free Christmas break.

Thanks for reading, see you in 2023! ðŸŽ‰
