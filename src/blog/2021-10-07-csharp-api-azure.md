A while back, I looked at creating an [API in Python](https://joshblewitt.dev/blog/2021-03-11-video-game-api/) and getting it hosted on Heroku. It was a great project to do and recently, I've been thinking of doing some smaller projects in .NET again.

I'm not a stranger to .NET. When I studied Computer Science at University, C# was the first programming language I studied. I worked on several projects using C# but I didn't go beyond the basics. At work, C# is heavily used. So after some time, I decided to get back into the language by building a few small projects.
