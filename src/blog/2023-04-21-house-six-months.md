Hey! Remember when I wrote that post about the long eight year journey to buy a house? Turns out I’ve now owned a home for _half a year_ so I decided to do a follow up post on what it’s been like. In fact, I can describe it in one word:

_Busy._

Owning a home is one thing, but when your first home is a new build, the amount of work that you have ahead of you is a lot.

And there’s moments where you go _“I don’t have this? How come I don’t have this? I thought houses came with this.”_

But slowly, things are coming together. It’s starting to feel like a home and not a house that’s for sale.

In terms of permanent fixtures, there’s so many things to buy. Here’s a list of things that I’ve bought that are a permanent fixture:

- Blinds x3
- House sign
- Curtain rail
- Hand towel rail x3
- Bathroom mirrors x2

And for furniture I’ve bought:

- Kitchen table, chairs, bench
- Coffee table
- TV bench
- Curtains
- Mattress
- Bed frame
- Side tables
- Bathroom cabinet
- Console table
- Chest of drawers
- Free standing Mirror
- Lamp shades x9
- Ring alarm system (_it’s honestly cool_)

And in terms of what I need to buy:

- Wardrobe (probably the biggest purchase)
- Keylite blinds (yes, special blinds) x2
- Vanity table
- Pictures
- Bed mattress for spare bedroom
- Bed frame for spare bedroom
- Side tables for spare bedroom
- Curtains for spare bedroom
- Extra office chair for my wife
- Garden furniture

As you can see, there is a mountain of work left to do.

There’s probably some things that I’ve forgotten from this list, and thinking about it, I could probably put more furniture in the bedroom (as it’s quite big, even bigger than the bedroom my parents had when I was a kid!)

The garden is another problem, the grass is getting long so I need to buy a mower and cut it.

I’ll admit that I didn’t think about the permanent fixtures that I’d need to buy in the first place. It was something I honestly thought that I didn’t need to buy!

In terms of how much I’ve spent, it’s hard to give an accurate answer but roughly I’d say somewhere between £2K and £3K. Furniture is pretty expensive, and I’ve been buying mine from Argos and IKEA most of the time. And with paying a mortgage, bills and cost of living, I would’ve liked to have done more but have been unable to.

Don’t get me wrong, I’ve enjoyed working on the house, it’s great to turn an empty house into a home. Working on the house has been a priority and has taken time away from other things (like updating this blog!).

I’ve also written up some key points that I’ve learnt about owning a home.

**Take your time**

At first I thought I could get majority of the house ready in a couple of weeks. I was _hugely_ wrong. Turns out buying and assembling furniture takes time. I will say, I’m quite good at assembling furniture.
