If there's one thing I've learnt since graduating from University is that technology is _constantly_ changing. It's important to read and learn not just for keeping up to date with the latest technologies but you can also take your learnings and use them in your career. I'm pretty sure that some of the modules that I studied at University have been updated to be more relevant to the current IT landscape.

Over the past year, I've been taking several courses, reading books and just doing research into many different things. And so on this blog post, I wanted to share some books and courses that I've done or used in the past.
