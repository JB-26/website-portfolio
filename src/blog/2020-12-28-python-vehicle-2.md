Welcome back!

It's time for part 2 of this Python series of my Vehicle Fleet Manager program.

In case you haven't read part one, please do! You can find part 1 [here](https://joshblewitt.dev/blog/2020-12-22-python-vehicle-1/)

And if you haven't cloned the repo for this project, you can do so [here](https://gitlab.com/JoshBl_/python-vehicle-manager)
