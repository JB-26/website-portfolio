When it comes to testing, I've had plenty of experience (I mean, seven years of experience) and if there's one thing I stand by it's my view on automation. Automation, in many ways, is the future of testing. Automation helps free time for QA Engineers to explore issues and other work. Plus, the journey to automate your application provides a great opportunity to advance your career.

Web automation isn't new, there are other solutions to this problem such as [selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) - but I've found selenium troublesome to use. From configuring web drivers to wrestling with syntax, waiting for pages to load, selenium might not be the best automation tool out there. So, [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) has changed that. With features such as time travel, automatic waiting and being able to configure different viewports really easily - Cypress is quickly becoming a popular tool for web automation.

With it's easy to use API, good documentation (seriously, the [kitchen sink](https://example.cypress.io/) is a really good source to practice cypress), getting started with Cypress is really easy. And it comes with support for different browsers out of the box! Tests for Cypress are written in JavaScript and having some knowledge of the language can be quite useful (as I'll go into detail).
