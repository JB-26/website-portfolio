![Blog](https://images.unsplash.com/reserve/LJIZlzHgQ7WPSh5KVTCB_Typewriter.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=792&q=80)

There are a lot of blogs on the internet. Blogs began to spread in the late 90‚Äôs and haven‚Äôt slowed down since. Starting out as having single authors, blogs have grown to multiple authors and now are people‚Äôs careers.

There are different types of blogs ranging from personal blogs, corporate blogs and microblogging (think Twitter as an example of this). It‚Äôs crazy to think how much blogs have grown over the years.

Nowadays, anyone can start their own blog in minutes with services like [medium](https://medium.com) in minutes. No longer do you need technical knowledge to get a blog up and running on the internet for everyone to see.

But here‚Äôs a question; _if there are so many blogs, why should I start a blog of my own?_

Well, I was trying to answer that question myself a few years ago when I started developing this website. And what was my answer? In my view, blogs can now be seen as a way to:

* Share your ideas and views
* A fun project for you to work on
* Share tutorials or fixes for problems you have faced
* Connect with others and grow your network.
* Expand your professional presence
* Learn new skills; such as getting your blog on a custom domain

I can certainly vouch for all these points. Especially the last one. I‚Äôve learnt so much about development since I started this website.

In fact, if it wasn‚Äôt for this blog, I wouldn‚Äôt have been considered for the role that I have. This blog demonstrated my interests and technical abilities, which helped me get an interview.

What‚Äôs important is to keep in mind is that your blog isn‚Äôt guaranteed to be a success or make money. If you want to blog, it‚Äôs because you want to. It will take time to build an audience, but it‚Äôs worth it.

If you‚Äôve got this far and you‚Äôre tempted to start a blog of your own, then read on! I‚Äôve put together a useful list of everything that I‚Äôve used to make my blog. From frameworks that I‚Äôve used to handy websites.

# Tools and resources
## The framework
There are so many frameworks out there for making blogs and websites. I‚Äôve got three suggestions for you to look at. Each using a different programming language!

### [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com)
This website was built with Gatsby, so it makes sense for me to talk about this framework first.

Gatsby is based on React so if you‚Äôre familiar with React you will feel at home with Gatsby.

There are several reasons why I chose Gatsby:
* There is excellent [documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs) and a great [tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/) for you to take a look at.
* Plenty of good [starters](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/) to take a look at.
* Plenty of [plugins](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/) for CMS, UI, Analytics and eCommerce.


### [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
Once upon a time, I made a blog that was made with using Jekyll, and I hosted it using GitHub pages. This framework is based on Ruby, so if you‚Äôre comfortable with that then you should take a look at this!

### [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/)
I have experience using Flask! It‚Äôs a microframework written in Python. If you want to see (a rather terrible) example, check out this example of an API hosted on Heroku [here](https://mighty-cliffs-81365.herokuapp.com).

## Websites
If you don‚Äôt want to build your blog with a framework, that‚Äôs okay! There are plenty of options out there for getting a blog up and running. Here are two that I am familiar with the most.

I‚Äôm not suggesting WordPress. It‚Äôs not the fastest tool, the most secure or [popular](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology-_-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-platforms).

### [Ghost](https://ghost.org)
If you‚Äôre familiar with blogs such as [coding horror](https://blog.codinghorror.com) or [Troy Hunt](https://www.troyhunt.com), these are built using Ghost.

Ghost is an open source product that is funded by it‚Äôs users. It has a free plan, [themes](https://ghost.org/themes/), [integrations](https://ghost.org/integrations/) and good [resources](https://ghost.org/resources/) for you to get started.

The plugins available allow you to grow your audience and sell premium memberships. Plus, there is support for newsletters.

### [Medium](https://medium.com)
Medium has been in the blogging space for nearly ten years now. It has a lot of users, has support for custom domains and has program where you can earn money from writing. It also has it‚Äôs own mobile application.

With it‚Äôs large number of users (over 100 million), you‚Äôll be able to find a following and grow your network.

However, with lots of writers comes the challenge of finding an audience and standing out.

Medium does come with some writing tools for you to get started and makes importing images and links fairly simple.


## Text editors and note takers
It‚Äôs all well and good by having a framework but you need the right tools to put it all together right? Here‚Äôs what I use!

### [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
I‚Äôve been using VSC for years now and it‚Äôs great. Sure, electron isn‚Äôt the best framework ever but the overall experience is still amazing for a free product.

I use VSC for working with Gatsby and it‚Äôs been great for that. Whether I‚Äôm working with JavaScript, CSS or Markdown files. VSC has support for them all, and the community has created some fantastic extensions as well! From supporting languages, themes to icons. There are plenty of extensions available for VSC.

### [Bear](https://bear.app)
I used to write all my blog posts in VSC. However, VSC isn‚Äôt exactly the best application for writing blog posts. It doesn‚Äôt check my spelling or grammar for example (which is to no fault of VSC, it‚Äôs a text editor not a word processor) so I wanted to find something that could export to Markdown, syncs between devices and has good support.

That‚Äôs when I started using Bear, and I haven‚Äôt looked back.

It has support for exporting your notes into many different file formats. Such as HTML, MD, PDF or even as an image. Bear also has a spellcheck, syncing between devices and more!

Sadly, there isn‚Äôt a version of Bear available for Android or Windows. But if you use Mac and iOS then you really should look into using Bear.

## Hosting
Your blog needs to be hosted somewhere, so where? I‚Äôve worked with a few services that you could use to host your blog.

### [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)
My blog is currently hosted on Netlify and I have nothing but good things to say about it.

Why use it? Here‚Äôs a few reasons:
* Support for plenty of frameworks (including Gatsby!)
* Connect your repo on GitHub (or GitLab!) and let Netlify detect what framework you‚Äôre using 
* Built in CI/CD
* Free to use!
* Add or register domains

It also has some good integrations with GitHub. Especially when you raise a pull request when the Netlify bot will leave a comment and update it as the checks progress.

If you use a framework like Gatsby then you should use Netlify.

### [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com)
Another platform that I‚Äôve used (which has an excellent CLI application). Heroku has support for many languages (Ruby, Python and Go for example) and you can get started for free!

Heroku also has some good documentation to help you get started if you are new to their platform.

If you use a framework that isn‚Äôt supported by Netlify, then you may want to take a look at using Heroku.

### [Dev domain name](https://get.dev)
This site uses the Dev domain name. If you work in development, why not use a .dev domain name? (Of course, you can use whichever domain you‚Äôd like)

Even WordPress have the [.blog](https://wordpress.com/domains/get/blog) domain!

## Extras!
Writing and managing a blog doesn‚Äôt stop with a platform, a framework. Here are some extra sites, applications that I use from time to time.

### [Codye](https://darioroa.com/codye/)
If you‚Äôre looking for a fun way to present your code, then checkout Codye for Mac. It takes your code and you can create an image to be used on blogs, documentation and even microblogging services like Twitter.

Free to use, also has an iOS application as well!

### [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com)
The images I use on blog come from Unsplash. The images hosted on Unsplash are free to use for commercial and non-commercial purposes. So it‚Äôs a great place to search for images that you want to use. Give it a look!

### [FontSpace](https://www.fontspace.com)
Every website uses custom fonts, and FontSpace is a good place to get free fonts that you can use on your website!

I have a [collection](https://www.fontspace.com/collection/commercial-c970mmy) which has fonts that you can take a look at and download for yourself to use if you wish.

I hope this post has given you information and maybe even a bit of confidence to start your own blog. Go forth and blog!

Thanks for reading! üëç
