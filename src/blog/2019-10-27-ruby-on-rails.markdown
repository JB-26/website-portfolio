So, this has been a long time coming - but yes here is my long awaited Ruby on Rails post! 🎉

The reason why this has been delayed for so long is simply that installing Rails on Windows is a challenge. In the end, I just created a VM on Amazon Web Services which runs Ubuntu.

And it is much better to manage, everything installs and works the way it should! 

Let's get started! For reference, [here](https://gitlab.com/JoshBl_/ruby_on_rails_sample_app) is the GitLab repo we are looking at today. As a guide, I used the Learn Enough course on [Rails](https://www.learnenough.com/ruby-on-rails-6th-edition).

So, as I previously mentioned, this is running on AWS [cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/). Free to use and sign up which is handy as I was having so much trouble getting Rails to work on Windows. Plus, I can still commit to GitLab from the VM which is great!

Before, we look at building a Rails application - let's take a step back and understand what is going on here. Let's look at the request/response cycle:

![The request/response cycle](https://i.imgur.com/eNCFtwq.jpg)

So after installing Rails on the VM (along with Yarn) - it's time to build our Rails app!

```
rails _6.0.0_ new sample_app
```

This command allows us to create a new application called 'sample_app' and we have specified the Rails version to be version 6.0.0. This will now create our Rails application.

At the moment though, it doesn't do very much. Let's change that!

First things first, we need to install the Gems listed in the gemfile.

```
bundle install --without production
```

This uses a flag to ensure that we are not using any production gems.

For this application, this will hold some static pages. This will make explaining Ruby on Rails easy. So - lets generate a controller with paramters of home and help.

```
rails generate controller StaticPages home help
```

With the command above; the two parameters allow us to create a controller called StaticPages with two parameters which we have defined as home and help. This controller will now have 2 actions called home and help. Which will look like this:

```
class StaticPagesController < ApplicationController
  def home
  end

  def help
  end
end
```

Wait a minute - those look like empty Ruby methods! They won't do anything! Well, looking at the request/response cycle, the Routes files will map the URL to the correct controller and action.

So lets take a look at the Routes file then.

```
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get 'static_pages/home'
  get 'static_pages/help'
  # For details on the DSL available within this file, see https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html
  root 'application#hello'
end
```

Ah! So, when the user enters static_pages/home (at the end of the address) as a URL address then it goes to the StaticPagesController which finds the View - which would be here:

![views for static pages](https://i.imgur.com/Q2pRsMb.jpg)

So, let take a look at the home view in a browser while Rails is running locally:

![Home for static pages](https://i.imgur.com/opO5vne.jpg)

And here is the HTML for the view:

```
<h1>Sample App</h1>
<p>
  This is the home page for the
  <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a>
  sample application.
</p>
```

So after the view has rendered the page in HTML, this is then sent back to the controller to be sent to the browser!

Well, that makes much more sense.

But I want to see the static pages home page when the user accesses the application - but how do we do that? 🤔

To do that - we need to configure the 'root' like so:

```
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get 'static_pages/home'
  get 'static_pages/help'
  get 'static_pages/about'
  # For details on the DSL available within this file, see https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html
  #application#hello
  root 'static_pages#home'
end
```

So now by default, whenever someone visits the application they will see the static page home page! 👏

It's great seeing this run locally and all - but what about seeing it run in a production environment?

I've got good news, this application runs in [Heroku](https://quiet-wave-28852.herokuapp.com/)! 🎉

So if you want to see this live Rails application, click the link above!

Why not visit some of the other pages? Such as:

- static_pages/about
- static_pages/help

These are other examples of routes in action for Ruby on Rails!

Well, that's it for part 1. I hope you've enjoyed this quick look at Ruby on Rails covering the basics of the request/response cycle.

Part 2 will be up next week! 👍

Thanks for reading!
