If there's anything that I'm guilty of since I started work, it's that I'm one of those people who check their email or messaging while on Holiday. In fact, I have responded to Teams messages while I was on Holiday. It's a terrible habit to have. You can't fully switch off from work and it just lingers in the back of your mind.

So on my most recent holiday (or staycation) I decided to fully disconnect myself from work. I had two weeks booked off and I intended to enjoy my time off without thinking about work.

So how can you do that in a world where we're more connected than ever before? You may have something like Teams or Slack installed on your personal phone where messages can appear at any time, and is it easy to just dismiss that notification without reading it?

Some might say "I'll just turn on my Out of Office message!" - 

So on my most recent holiday, I decided to fully disconnect myself from work. So that means:
- No email
- No messages from Teams
- No calls
- Nothing from work at all
