In my last [post](https://joshblewitt.dev/blog/2021-08-25-wfh-review/) I talked about my thoughts on working from home. I ended the post by asking if working from home really is the future of work. This got me thinking - I wonder if I could perform some data analysis and see if I can find out if people really are returning to the office.

I decided to take a look at Google Trends first, as that's open for anyone to use and it's easy to get started with.

For my first search was to look at if there was any interest in offices in general. I decided to take a look at the trends in one of the more popular office space providers; [wework](https://trends.google.co.uk/trends/explore?date=2019-01-01%202021-08-30&geo=GB&q=wework). And the results didn't show a good sign.

I also took a look at another office space provider; [Regus](https://trends.google.co.uk/trends/explore?date=2019-01-01%202021-08-30&geo=GB&q=Regus). And it didn't look too good there either.

So it seems that going back to the office isn't on the cards for many. But what we do know is that the pandemic did cause house prices to spike as high as [13% (from June 2021 to June 2021)](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-58274811), as people begin to look for housing with more space. So naturally, the search term for buying a house saw an increase.

As a first time buyer myself, house prices at the moment aren't great. So what are people doing then? Turns out people are interested in [home improvements](https://trends.google.co.uk/trends/explore?date=2019-01-01%202021-08-30&geo=GB&q=home%20improvement), with interest returning to 2019 levels.

Similar results can be seen for [home extensions](https://trends.google.co.uk/trends/explore?date=2019-01-01%202021-08-30&geo=GB&q=house%20extension).

I then decided to take a stab at something completely different. What if someone doesn't have the space to make improvements or make an extension? So I punched in the term of [garden office](https://trends.google.co.uk/trends/explore?date=2019-01-01%202021-08-30&geo=GB&q=%2Fm%2F064pl3n) and to my surprise - people are really wanting a garden office! And the demand for it doesn't appear to be slowing down!

So I decided to take a look at garden offices, and there are quite a few to choose from.
- [SMART](https://www.smartgardenoffices.co.uk/)
- [The Garden Office](https://www.thegardenoffice.co.uk/)
- [Garden Buildings Direct](https://www.gardenbuildingsdirect.co.uk/garden-offices)
- Even [Wickes](https://www.wickes.co.uk/Products/Gardens/Garden-Buildings/Garden-Office/c/1084000) sells garden offices!

And looking at the FAQ's on [The Garden Office](https://www.thegardenoffice.co.uk/design-your-space/faqs/) - it doesn't need planning permission in most cases (which seems kind of crazy to me - I mean, it's a stand alone building!)

So it seems people aren't just ready to go back to the office, some are never going back and want to make improvements to their own home instead.

But the cost of having your own garden office isn't cheap. You'll need to spend thousands, up to tens of thousands for a garden office in your home. And that is if you have the space for a garden office in the first place.

So what about those who don't have the space for a garden office? Or even space for a home office?

This is where companies such as wework, Regus and Spaces come into play.

Taking a look at [Regus](https://www.regus.com/en-gb/united-kingdom/milton-keynes/midsummer-court-1617) in my hometown for example, you could get a desk from ¬£150 per month. This might be appealing for someone who used to go into London by train and is looking for somewhere to focus on their work.

So is the office dead? No way. What's happening is people are making the investment in a new environment to work in. Wether it be in the home, in the garden, in a coworking space or even returning to the office altogether.
