I was recently thinking of what applications I use every week. Why I use them, when I use them, should I use them and so on. There are plenty of applications out there now, all trying to find their way onto our home screens. Just because there are a lot of applications, doesn't mean that they're _all_ good.

So I thought I'd share in this post the applications I use across all my devices and why. You might find a few that you might want to try yourself!
