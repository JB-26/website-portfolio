I was recently thinking of what applications I use every week. Why I use them, when I use them, should I use them and so on. There are plenty of applications out there now, all trying to find their way onto our home screens. Just because there are a lot of applications, doesn't mean that they're _all_ good.

If you think about it, there are _loads_ of applications on the App Store for iOS devices. But how many of them are of a decent quality? How many of them are worth downloading? In my experience, for every good application, there's a few bad ones.

So I thought I'd share in this post, a list of the applications I use across all my devices and why. You might find a few that you might want to try yourself!

# [Signal](https://signal.org/)

Out of all the online messagning applications out there at the moment. Signal should be the one you should use.

- Uses end-to-end encryption
- No ads
- No trackers
- Not owned by Facebook
- Works on Android, iOS, Mac, Windows and Linux!
- You can see their applications on [Github](https://github.com/signalapp)
- Free!

Do check it out, it's a fantastic application!

# [Discord](https://discord.com/)

If you're looking for a community and speak to others, then Discord is the application for you!

- Great design, consistent across platforms
- Lots of communities
- Free!

# [Microsoft To Do](https://todo.microsoft.com/tasks/en-gb/)

Out of all the to do applications out there, I like what Microsoft has created.

- Nice design
- Works on Windows, Mac, Android and iOS
- Sync your lists across devices
- Each list can have it's own theme
- Print, Email and share lists
- Free!

# [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/uk/)

An application that needs no introduction, a great application for listening to music and podcasts!

- Lots of songs and podcasts available
- Available on the web, mobile and desktop
- Good design
- Free tier available!

# [Apollo for Reddit](https://apolloapp.io/)

I've used plenty of third party Reddit applications. I've even used the official Reddit application. However, none of them can beat Apollo!

Developed by former Apple employee, [Christian Selig](https://twitter.com/ChristianSelig), this is a fantastic application to view Reddit.

- Built from the ground up for iPhone and iPad
- Great performance
- Regular updates
- Fantastic UI
- Free, with paid tiers (it's worth paying to show support!)

If you use Reddit, you'll want to download Apollo! Out of everything on this list, Apollo is my most used application.

# [Tweetbot](https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/)

An iOS exclusive application, now on version 6! It uses a subscription model that won't be for everyone's taste, but I'm happy to support the developers.

- Great design!
- Works well on iPhone and iPad!
- No ads!
- Lots of themes and settings. From the font, font size and behaviours.

# [1Password](https://1password.com/)

I used to be a fan of LastPass but then I discovered 1Password and I haven't looked back. If you're in the market for a new password manager (or even looking for one to begin with), you may want to take a look at 1Password.

There is no free tier for 1Password, but I think it's worth it.

- Available on mobile, browsers, and desktops
- Really good design that's consistent across platforms
- Stores your 2FA keys!
- Has great features such as sharing passwords securely within a link to those who don't have 1Password

# [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

How could I not include this here? I'm a fan of VSC! In fact, I wrote a post about my setup last [year!](https://joshblewitt.dev/blog/tour-of-my-vsc-env-16-10-2020/)

- There's an extension for _everything_
- Regular updates
- Big community
- There's a web version available too!
- Free!

# [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/new/)

My current web browser of choice is Mozilla Firefox. It's performance has improved greatly over the years and it has some great features such as picture in picture mode.

- Good features such as picture in picture and screenshots
- Lots of extensions available
- Good performance
- Free!

# [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/)

I'm not a fan of Google. So my search engine of choice is DuckDuckGo!

- Doesn't follow you with adverts
- Has a good mobile browser too!

# [Bear](https://bear.app/)

I've been using this recently and Bear is a very powerful note taking application. A lot of the features are locked behind a paywall but I think it's worth looking into if you're wanting a decent note taking application.

- Optimised for Mac and iOS devices
- Can export to MD, PDF, HTML, DOCX and more!
- Lots of themes
- Syncing with other devices
- Apple Pencil support on iPad!
- It's bear-y good (_sorry_)

# That's a wrap!

If you have any application suggestions, why not post them on the tweet I shared or on the LinkedIn post?

Thanks for reading! üëè
