#Website 2.0! 👏

Hi! 👋 It's been some time since I last posted a blog post! Well, I've been quite busy recently. Following the development of my first web application, Ocean, I decided to think on what I wanted to be as a developer. I enjoyed creating the web version of Ocean and there is so much going in terms of creating applications for the web. So I decided to look at becoming a *web developer.*

So in light of this, I decided to create a brand new personal website from scratch. But this website is built using Gatsby - which is an open soruce framework that uses React to develop applications and websites. I've seen that React is a modern JavaScript library so I decided to spend some time learning it, and this website is a result of my work! 👨‍💻

A bonus of using Gatsby is now that my blog is now on the same URL as my personal website! 👏 This means that my Jekyll blog hosted on GitLab is no longer used - this will help keep things tidy and easier to manage.

All of my previous blog posts have also been moved to this new blog as well.

I'll be resuming regular updates here now that I've finished this website.

Look forward for new posts aimed at web development! 👍
