Recently, me and my wife been assembling flat pack furniture in our new home. **A lot** of flat pack furniture (I’ve created quite the collection of Allen keys). And during the fun process of unpacking and then assembling furniture, I actually learnt a few important lessons in regards to problem solving.

## Patience
I have a lot of patience when it comes to most things. But assembling furniture however, taught me that patience is part of the process in understanding something. I spend a lot of time reading the instructions of the funiture before I start building the furniture.

It might sound odd, but trust me on this.

It takes patience to understand what you need to do _and_ how to do it. It’s like when I started learning Python. It took patience to understand the concepts of the programming language and putting my knowledge into practice.


## Take a break (and then come back to it)
The biggest lesson came from one flat pack which was a bench for a dining table. Early in the instructions, we had to attach a stretcher to a right and left leg. Seems simple enough. But the instructions however told us to screw _into_ the wood on the bench leg from the stretcher.

That didn’t seem right to me. But after checking the instructions, that really was what needed to be done.

But after several attempts, it wasn’t working. The screw wasn’t going into the wooden leg properly. The attached leg and stretcher was loose and wasn’t stable.

No way would that be safe to sit on.

After spending thirty to forty minutes, me and my wife agreed to take a lunch break.

During the lunch break, I was able to think and recharge. And that moment of being away from it provided me with a brain wave.

And when I got back, I had the complete bench assembled in no time. I had the idea of assembling the furniture on the floor instead of a box of another flat pack, and that made all the difference.


## Get a second opinion

There were a few times when I needed to check if I was doing something correctly. And on a few times, I needed that second opinion from my wife.



## Team work!

Some things need more than one person, and that's what I found on a few flat packs. I did try and attempt it by myself but I quickly found that I needed some help.

And that’s about it!

I’m pretty sure that after this move, I am never going to want to go through another flat pack ever again.

Well, until the next move.
