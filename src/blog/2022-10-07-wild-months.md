Hey! ðŸ‘‹ 

Itâ€™s been a while! Whatâ€™s been going on? A lot.

* Iâ€™ve got married!
* Iâ€™ve completed my house purchase!
* Traveled to the USA and back! (Ate a lot of food)
* Bought goods for the new house!
* Made (slow) progress on a Udemy course!

So Iâ€™ve been super busy these past few months. And things arenâ€™t slowing down asâ€¦

* Iâ€™m moving into my new house
* Getting furniture for said new house
* Organising, internet, electricity, gas etc for the house
* Getting ready for Christmas! (Where I fully plan on doing _nothing_. Iâ€™ve had an extremely busy year)

On top of this, Iâ€™ve also managed to spend some time making some improvements to my website!

So, whatâ€™s new? Smaller images. A problem Iâ€™ve noticed recently is that the images I was using for the website were really big. And it made the performance quite slow when rendering the images (especially for users who have never visited the website before).

So, the images that were used are now _much_ smaller. So for new users, you wonâ€™t need to wait several seconds to see an image on the website.

Apart from some new fixes, whatâ€™s next? Iâ€™ve got a post about the meta verse coming up soon which I started working on before I got married. Plus, Iâ€™ve got some ideas for content about owning a home (_and all the stress that comes with it_).

Until next time!
