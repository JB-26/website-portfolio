Hey! ðŸ‘‹ 

Itâ€™s been a while! Whatâ€™s been going on? A lot.

* Iâ€™ve got married!
* Iâ€™ve completed my house purchase!
* Traveled to the USA and back! (Ate a lot of food. One day I'll finish a meal at The Cheesecake Factory.)
* Bought goods for the new house!
* Made (slow) progress on a Udemy course!

So Iâ€™ve been super busy these past few months. And things arenâ€™t slowing down asâ€¦

* Iâ€™m moving _into_ my new house
* Getting furniture for said new house
* Organising, internet, electricity, gas etc for the house
* Getting ready for Christmas! (Where I fully plan on doing _nothing_. Iâ€™ve had an extremely busy year and I need to put my feet up.)

On top of this, Iâ€™ve also managed to spend some time making some improvements to my website!

So, whatâ€™s new? Smaller images. A problem Iâ€™ve noticed recently is that the images I was using for the website were really big. And it made the performance quite slow when rendering the images (especially for users who have never visited the website before). Plus, the icons in the footer were impacted by this as the icons wouldn't render properly until the images on the page had finished loading.

So, the images that are used now are _much_ smaller. So for new users, you wonâ€™t need to wait long to see an image on the website.

Apart from some new fixes, whatâ€™s next? Iâ€™ve got a post about the meta verse coming up soon which I started working on before I got married, and a draft post about Mac applications that I use (which needs some more work). Plus, Iâ€™ve got some ideas for content about what I've learnt since buying a house (_and all the stress that comes with it_). Oh, and some tech related posts as well.

Until next time!
