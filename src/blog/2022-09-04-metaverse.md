# If the Metaverse is the future, then I don’t want to be a part of it
_I’m pretty sure it’s just Second Life anyway_

Alright. 

I’ve been ignoring the Metaverse for long enough, and the recent image that Mark Zuckerberg posted just left me with more questions and no excitement or interest about the Metaverse (or the new internet as people call it).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Mark Zuckerberg launches Horizon Worlds in France and Spain with an eye-gougingly ugly VR selfie. Meta&#39;s metaverse ploy is surely dying in the dark. <a href="https://t.co/j0l6yTYye4">pic.twitter.com/j0l6yTYye4<_a><_p>&mdash; Ordinary Things (@ordinarytings) <a href="https://twitter.com/ordinarytings/status/1559520901443510274?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 16, 2022<_a><_blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

_Out of everything in this picture, the empty looking eyes scare me the most_

If the future of communication involves me looking like _that_ then I don’t want a part of it. Especially if my avatar loses their legs as shown in the Horizon Worlds trailer.

I’m just amazed that a company that’s worth **billions** of dollars, thinks that the screenshot by Mark would convince people that the Metaverse is the future is laughable.

Graphically, I’d expect it to look better considering how much money Meta is throwing at the Metaverse (to be fair, Meta responded by sharing a somewhat improved screenshot [recently](https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/19/23313469/mark-zuckerberg-horizon-worlds-screenshot-memes-response-upgrades). But it still looks creepy.)

In 2021, Meta spent at least [$10 billion](https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22745381/facebook-reality-labs-10-billion-metaverse) on it’s Metaverse division. And I can only imagine that this figure will only increase as the years go on.

I just cannot imagine sitting down for a serious business meeting or job interview and I have to use the Metaverse. The idea of that sounds awful. Even Microsoft is incorporating 3D avatars and virtual meeting spaces into [Teams](https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22758974/microsoft-teams-metaverse-mesh-3d-avatars-meetings-features) called Mesh. I’m not sure how I’d feel if the person I was speaking to was a 3D avatar and not the actual person through a video call. It would be hard to judge the other person’s body language for example.

_On an unrelated note, can you imagine people using underpowered business laptops and trying to render 3D avatars and virtual meeting spaces in Teams? Chaos!_

I can’t imagine turning up to work and being told to build something in the Metaverse for Teams.

I struggle to understand the following:
* What problem is the Metaverse _solving_?
* Why I would _want_ to use the Metaverse?
* And _what_do I do in the Metaverse?

The first comparison that I think of when I look at the Metaverse is [Second Life](https://secondlife.com/), and [VRChat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VRChat?wprov=sfti1).

There was once a time where Second Life had so much hype. It had:
* Sweden opening an [embassy](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6310915.stm) in the game
* The comedian Jimmy Carr held a [gig](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6227869.stm)
* People buy and sell [property](https://money.cnn.com/pr/subs/2006/10/20/technology/second_life_money/index.htm) for **real** money

The BBC wrote an article in [2009](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/8367957.stm) asking what happened to Second Life, after all the hype, excitement and initial investment from companies such as IBM, and American Apparel - nothing came from it.

When I was in university, during my first year in 2011, one of the first modules I did was called ‘Introduction to Electronic Origination’, and we had to create a movie in Second Life. It was a bizarre experience to say the least. I was surprised by how successful it was and what the community could create (and also how active the community was).

In fact, in 2016, Second Life had a GDP of [$500 million](https://www.vice.com/en/article/z43mwj/why-is-second-life-still-a-thing-gaming-virtual-reality) which is _wild._

I’m curious to see what happens to Second Life. It would be pretty amazing if Second Life was able to outlive whatever Meta creates.

Then, there is [VRChat](https://hello.vrchat.com/). This is basically a good example of what the Metaverse currently is; a sandbox of infinite worlds created by the community.

And it found success. It brought people together, and the community created content for everyone to use. There are plenty of videos in YouTube that highlight what the community have created.

However, there have been [safety](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-60415317) concerns about what words have been created by users. It’s a legitimate concern to have.

Now don’t get me wrong, I think VR has a lot of potential to be a phenomenal platform. From games to socialising, I think VR is going to change how people interact with content.

However, selling VR as a games platform has been established. Sony has [PlayStation VR](https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/ps-vr/) and Oculus has a fantastic range of games available.

But - there is difference between selling the Metaverse as a form of entertainment and as a way of working.

But there are plenty of hurdles to jump over first:
* VR headsets can be expensive (see headsets like the [Valve Index](https://store.steampowered.com/sub/354231/))
* VR headsets can start to feel uncomfortable after a period of time
* Motion sickness in VR
* Not everyone is convinced by VR
* Safety concerns

There are already early signs that the Metaverse is already failing to launch. Tinder, for example, [stepped back](https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/3/23290152/tinder-metaverse-tinderverse-coins-disappointing-earnings)  from their Metaverse ambitions and parted ways with their CEO who had been in the job for less than a year.

Even Meta themselves said that in [Q1 this year](https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/27/meta-facebook-q1-2022-earnings/) that their Metaverse division lost **$3B**. With Mark claiming that the year 2030 would be “exciting”. I’m not sure Meta’s investors can wait until 2030 to see the outcome of spending billions.

I’m not sure what the future holds for the Metaverse. But whatever it is, I just hope avatars get legs.
