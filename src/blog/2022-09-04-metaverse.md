Alright.

I’ve been ignoring the Metaverse for long enough, and the recent image that Mark Zuckerberg posted just left me with more questions, no excitement, or interest about the Metaverse (or the new internet as some people call it).

_Out of everything in this picture, the empty looking eyes scare me the most._

Even MP Matt Hancock has joined the Metaverse with an equally creepy looking [avatar](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/matt-hancock-metaverse-avatar-creepy-125437801.html).

If the future of communication involves me looking like _that_ then I don’t want a part of it. Especially if my avatar loses their legs as shown in the [Horizon Worlds](https://youtu.be/02kCEurWkqU) trailer.

I’m just amazed that a company that’s worth **billions** of dollars, thinks that the screenshot by Mark would convince people that the Metaverse is the future is laughable (and also how Mark thought that screenshot would convince people to try Horizon Worlds is bizarre)

Graphically, I’d expect it to look better considering how much money Meta is throwing at this (to be fair, Meta responded by sharing a somewhat improved screenshot [recently](https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/19/23313469/mark-zuckerberg-horizon-worlds-screenshot-memes-response-upgrades). But it still looks creepy.)

In 2021, Meta spent at least [$10 billion](https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22745381/facebook-reality-labs-10-billion-metaverse) on it’s Metaverse division. And I can only imagine that this figure will only increase as the years go on.

By the way, Meta has now started calling their employees ['Metamates'](https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/zuckerberg-calls-staff-metamates-memo-060749258.html), which sounds _incredibly_ cringey (what's wrong with calling everyone employees?)

You might be wondering _"what is the Metaverse anyway?"_, and put simply it's a digital space which is made of digital representations of things. Like people, objects, places etc. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw6UCwCt4bE) by Microsoft does a good job of explaining what the Metaverse is.

I just cannot imagine sitting down for a serious business meeting or job interview and I have to use the Metaverse. The idea of that sounds awful and awkward. Even Microsoft is incorporating 3D avatars and virtual meeting spaces into [Teams](https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22758974/microsoft-teams-metaverse-mesh-3d-avatars-meetings-features) called [Mesh](https://news.microsoft.com/innovation-stories/mesh-for-microsoft-teams/). I’m not sure how I’d feel if the person I was speaking to was a 3D avatar and not the actual person through a video call at a job interview. It would be hard to judge the other person’s body language for example.

_I just want to have legs!_

On a related note, can you imagine people using underpowered business laptops and trying to render 3D avatars and virtual meeting spaces in Teams? Chaos! I know Teams doesn't have amazing performance to begin with (thanks Electron) but I can't imagine rendering 3D environments would make things any better. Plus, I can't imagine businesses are going to rush out and buy VR headsets as those are still expensive.

I struggle to understand the following about the Metaverse:

- What problem is the Metaverse _solving_?
- Why I would _want_ to use the Metaverse?
- And _what_ do I do in the Metaverse?

If the Metaverse is the 'new internet', what's wrong with the 'old internet'?

The first few comparisons that I think of when I look at the Metaverse is [Second Life](https://secondlife.com/), and [VRChat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VRChat?wprov=sfti1).

There was once a time where Second Life had so much hype. It had:

- Sweden opening an [embassy](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6310915.stm) in the game
- The comedian Jimmy Carr held a [gig](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6227869.stm)
- People buying and selling [property](https://money.cnn.com/pr/subs/2006/10/20/technology/second_life_money/index.htm) for **real** money

The BBC wrote an article in [2009](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/8367957.stm) asking what happened to Second Life, after all the hype, excitement and initial investment from companies such as IBM, and American Apparel - nothing came from it.

When I was in university, during my first year in 2011, one of the first modules I did was called ‘Introduction to Electronic Origination’, and we had to create a movie in Second Life. It was a bizarre experience to say the least. I was surprised by how successful it was and what the community could create (and also how active the community was).

In fact, in 2016, Second Life had a GDP of [$500 million](https://www.vice.com/en/article/z43mwj/why-is-second-life-still-a-thing-gaming-virtual-reality) which is _wild._ Considering Second Life came out in 2003, I'm amazed it has continued to exist today with people still using it. Maybe Second Life was ahead of it's time?

I’m curious to see what happens to Second Life. It would be pretty amazing if Second Life was able to outlive whatever Meta creates.

Then, there is [VRChat](https://hello.vrchat.com/). This is basically a good example of what the Metaverse currently is; a sandbox of infinite worlds created by the community. Where people are represented by digital avatars.

And it found success. It brought people together, and the community created content for everyone to use. There are plenty of videos in YouTube that highlight what the community have created. However, there have been [safety](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-60415317) concerns about what words have been created by users. It’s a legitimate concern to have.

Speaking of safety, there is also privacy concerns around Meta itself. I'm sure whatever Metaverse they create will no doubt harvest data from it's users.

One key element I've noticed when it comes to the Metaverse is the role of VR. Meta bought Oculus and is using it's technology as part of the company's ambitions for the Metaverse. There is also [Windows Mixed Reality](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mixed-reality/windows-mixed-reality) by Microsoft which works with [Mesh](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mesh). No matter how you look at it, VR is a key component for the Metaverse to be successful.

Selling VR as a games platform has been established. Sony has [PlayStation VR](https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/ps-vr/) and Oculus has a fantastic range of games available. Plus, Valve offer their own VR headset, [Index](https://www.valvesoftware.com/en/index), for Steam.

But - there is a difference between selling VR as a form of entertainment and as a way of working with the Metaverse. I can see VR growing in popularity to play games, but I don't think the Metaverse will convince many to buy a headset.

There are also plenty of hurdles to jump over first:

- VR headsets can be expensive (see headsets like the [Valve Index](https://store.steampowered.com/sub/354231/))
- VR headsets can start to feel uncomfortable after a period of time
- Motion sickness in VR
- Not everyone is convinced by (or wants) VR
- Safety concerns in a Metaverse

There are already early signs that the Metaverse is already failing to launch. Tinder, for example, [stepped back](https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/3/23290152/tinder-metaverse-tinderverse-coins-disappointing-earnings) from their Metaverse ambitions and parted ways with their CEO who had been in the job for less than a year.

Even Meta themselves said that in [Q1 this year](https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/27/meta-facebook-q1-2022-earnings/) that their Metaverse division lost **$3B**. With Mark claiming that the year 2030 would be “exciting”. I’m not sure Meta’s investors can wait until 2030 to see the outcome of spending billions. Next month, [Meta Connect](https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/6/23339396/meta-connect-project-cambria-facebook-metaverse) will show the company's next high end VR headset.

But the initial failures isn't stopping companies from exploring the Metaverse. [Kate Spade](https://www.yahoo.com/video/kate-spade-enters-metaverse-offer-164450002.html) has created a shopping experience, where there is a handbag that can only be purchased by using their virtual world.

I’m not sure what the future holds for the Metaverse. I'm not convinced it's the next generation of the internet. But whatever it is, I just hope avatars get legs.
