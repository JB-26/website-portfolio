I don’t often talk about my tastes in music or even what podcasts I listen to, so I thought I’d type up some of my favourite albums and podcasts.

Hope you enjoy this slightly short blog post, I’ll be back with another longer post soon! *Who knows, you may even find something new to listen to!*

# Music

I’m not so sure how to describe my taste in music. It’s wide and varied, and when I was younger, I didn’t have much taste in music. I didn’t really care for music I guess? But over time, I started to pay attention to music.

So here’s a small list of some of my favourite albums.

## Hotel California - Eagles

*I know this looks like one of the most chosen albums ever but hear me out.*

This was my first vinyl I bought after I listened to the album on Spotify. I often listened to this album when I was at work or while I was working on my hobbyist programming.

I’d honestly recommend this album to anyone, even if you’re not into rock music.

Apart from Hotel California, my favourite tracks are Victim of Love, New Kid in Town, and Life in the fast lane.

## Blade Runner - Vangelis

My favourite movie of all time, with an equally amazing soundtrack. The music to this movie certainly grabs your attention. The main title is my favourite track on this album.

## Blackstar - David Bowie

David Bowie’s final album is certainly a striking one. 

## Random Access Memories - Daft Punk

The soundtrack of summer 2013! Get Lucky still remains a favourite song of mine.

And hey, the 10th anniversary of this album came out recently! I need to pick it up at some point.

## Royal Blood - Royal Blood

If I were to pick an album that got me to pay attention to music more, it would be this one.

Every single track is fantastic. Personal favourites are Figure it out, Loose change, Little Monster and Ten Tonne Skeleton.

## R.E.M - In time: the best of R.E.M

I remember listening to this in the car when I was 12 or 13 years old and this is a great album to listen to. My dad introduced R.E.M to me. Brings back plenty of memories for me.

My favourite tracks on this album are; Man on the moon, Bad day, Losing my religion, and Orange Crush.

## Nothing but thieves - Nothing but thieves

I discovered this band by looking through some recommendations on Apple Music, and this is a great album. Nothing But Thieves has grown on me to become one of my favourite bands to date.

My favourite songs are Itch, Wake up call and Painkiller.

## How will I know if Heaven will find me? - The Amazons

Another band I recently discovered, The Amazons. Their latest album is worth a listen if you’re a fan of rock.

My favourite songs are Bloodrush, Northern star and In the morning.

# Podcasts

I’ve listened to podcasts since I was a teenager. I think I first started listening to them in 2007, and the idea I had a downloadable radio show which I could listen to at any time was mind-blowing to me back then. I honestly can’t tell you how many hours I’ve listened to podcasts. *Plus, I honestly would like to launch my own Podcast, it seems like a fun hobby to have.*

## CAGcast

This was the first podcast I **ever** subscribed to, I saw one of the hosts YouTube video of unboxing a PlayStation 3 in Japan and decided to checkout their podcast. Been listening to this show for over 15 years! A fun video game podcast for those who are interested.

## Brad & Will made a Tech Pod

Brad Shoemaker and Will Smith (not *that* Will Smith) started this podcast in 2019 with the purpose of discussing a new technology topic each episode.

It’s an entertaining podcast that goes deep into technology. Highly recommended to those who want to learn more about technology.

## Fire Escape Cast

Dan Ryckert, Mary Kish and Mike Mahardy have created a very entertaining video game podcast. Give it a spin if you’re looking for a fun discussion on video games and life in general.

## The Jeff Gerstmann Show

*Jeff Gerstmann is still a threat!*

Jeff has been working in the video game industry for such a long time and it’s great to hear Jeff’s views on video games. Jeff is an excellent podcast host, if you’re looking for an in depth discussion on video games and talks about life, definitely check out the Jeff Gestmann show.
