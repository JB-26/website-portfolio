It's been over a year since we started working from home - something I thought I'd never do. I'm not a fan of change, I prefer a routine, so I thought that in this week's blog post I'd share my thoughts on working from home.

# The setup

A challenge that I found early on is space on my desk. It's not unusual for me to have multiple devices on my desk (at one stage recently, I had my iPhone, iPad and Mac on my desk!)

So, a few months after the switch to working from home, I decided to invest into a bigger desk. In fact, here's a picture of my setup!


There are a few things I need to do, such as upgrading the webcam to something more modern. I'm still using a [Microsoft LifeCam HD-3000](https://www.amazon.co.uk/LifeCam-HD-3000-Port-EMEA-black/dp/B0099XD1PU/ref=sr_1_3?crid=AQ08N5AK9ZHW&dchild=1&keywords=microsoft+lifecam+hd-3000&qid=1629924674&sprefix=microsoft+lifec%2Caps%2C149&sr=8-3) which came out in 2010! üò±

The desk came from IKEA (which I can't remember the name), and it's a __massive__ desk. Seriously, I can fit so much stuff on here! It's great when I'm using multiple devices. When I got my desk, I ended up rotating a lot of the furniture in the room I'm in to make better use of the space available.

For those wondering about the rest of the setup...

- Work laptop is Lenovo ThinkPad
- My PC (where I do most of my projects on, like this website!)
    - Intel Core i7 6700K @ 4.00GHz (Skylake)
    - 16GB Dual-Channel RAM @ 1499MHz
    - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 (MSI)
    - The OS runs on a Samsung SSD 750 EVO 250GB
    - Whilst everything else is on a 1TB Seagate hard drive
- The monitor is an Acer Predator XB271HU 27 inch Monitor (1440p resolution)
- The speakers are Creative T30 (still going strong after six years of daily use!)
- Headphones are Microsoft Surface Headphones 2 (Multi device support is so useful!)
- The mouse is Microsoft Intellimouse (still one of the best wired mice available)
- The keyboard is a Ducky One 2 SF 65% mechanical keyboard (Cherry Brown MX switches)

I like my setup but I think I'll be upgrading my main PC at some point (maybe I'll switch to a Mac for my next machine)
