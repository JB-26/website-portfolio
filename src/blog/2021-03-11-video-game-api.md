##Introduction

So recently I've been learning about [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/), the web framework for Python and I decided I'd take a stab at building my own RESTful API. And as an extra challenge, I decided to see if I could host it on Heroku!

So for the API I developed 'The Video Game API'.

A free to use API where anyone can add games to a database, view games, update games, search for games and delete games from the database.

So, how can we achieve this?

Well, by using [Flask RESTful](https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) we can do just that!

If you want to see the API in action, you can see it running live on [Heroku!](https://mighty-cliffs-81365.herokuapp.com/) Or if you want to take a look at the code and run it locally, you can visit the repo on GitLab [here.](https://gitlab.com/JoshBl_/python-flask-api)

And with that, let's get started!
